### AI Native Developer · Building cognitive systems that remember, reason & orchestrate

*I don't just use AI to code — I build systems where AI and humans think together.*

## What I'm About

I'm an **AI Native Developer** — which means AI isn't a tool I bolt on at the end, it's woven into every layer of how I build, think, and ship.

My current obsession: **giving AI persistent memory and multi-agent reasoning**, while keeping everything **local-first** and under your control. No black-box cloud lock-in. Your data stays yours.

I work at the intersection of **cognitive architectures**, **multi-agent orchestration**, and **developer tooling** — building the infrastructure that makes AI genuinely useful day after day, not just demo after demo.

## Featured Projects

### Synaptic — Cognitive Memory for AI

> *What if your AI assistant actually remembered what you worked on last week?*

A local-first memory system that gives AI **persistent, searchable, evolving knowledge** across sessions. Built on real cognitive science (ACT-R activation models), not just vector search.

**How it works:**
- 🗄️ **PostgreSQL + pgvector** — semantic memory storage with cosine similarity search
- 🧮 **ACT-R cognitive model** — memories decay, strengthen, and activate like human memory
- 🔌 **MCP protocol** — plugs directly into Claude, making every conversation context-aware
- 🔒 **100% local** — your knowledge never leaves your machine

**By the numbers:** 1,500+ memories stored · 10 categories · semantic retrieval in <100ms

`PostgreSQL 17` `pgvector` `Python` `FastAPI` `Ollama` `MCP`

### Multi-Agent Strategic Analysis — 39 Experts, One Orchestrator

> *One AI agent is smart. Thirty-nine specialists orchestrated together are transformative.*

A multi-agent pipeline where a **General Manager** dispatches analysis across **5 strategic domains**, each powered by specialized expert agents — from Chaos Theory to Viable System Model cybernetics.

**Architecture:**
```
                    ┌─── Design & Dependencies (8 agents)
                    ├─── Experience & Identity (8 agents)
General Manager ────┼─── Value Flow & Strategy (8 agents)
                    ├─── People & Growth (8 agents)
                    └─── Structure & Governance (7 agents)
                                    │
                            Chief Reporter ── Final Synthesis
```

**Key design choices:**
- ⚡ **N8N orchestration** — visual workflow for 39-agent coordination with webhook triggers
- 📡 **FastAPI SSE streaming** — real-time progress as each agent completes its analysis
- 🗃️ **Per-agent persistence** — every intermediate result stored, not just the final report
- 🐍 **LangGraph architecture** — parallel domain execution with conditional synthesis

## The AI Native Dev Philosophy

```
Traditional Dev          AI Native Dev
─────────────           ──────────────
Write code        →     Co-create with AI agents
Debug manually    →     39 specialized analysts in parallel
Forget context    →     Cognitive memory across sessions
Cloud-dependent   →     Local-first, your data stays yours
One-shot prompts  →     Persistent knowledge that compounds
```

I believe the next wave of developer tooling isn't about better autocomplete — it's about **systems that learn alongside you**. Every bug you fix, every architecture decision, every pattern you discover should make your AI collaborator smarter *for your specific context*.

That's what I'm building.
